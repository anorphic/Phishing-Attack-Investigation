# Phishing-Attack-Investigation
Introduction
Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats. In these attacks, cybercriminals trick people into giving away sensitive information (like passwords or bank details) by pretending to be someone trustworthy, such as a bank or service provider.
This project is designed to help you learn how to detect, examine, and respond to phishing emails effectively.
