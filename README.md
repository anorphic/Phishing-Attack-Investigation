# Project : Phishing-Attack-Investigation
## Introduction
Phishing attacks are among the most widespread threats in cybersecurity. Attackers often impersonate trusted sources to trick users into revealing sensitive data like passwords or credit card details.
This hands-on project walks you through identifying, analyzing, and reporting phishing emails in a simulated environment.

## Pre-requisites

Before starting, you should be familiar with:

- Basics of how email systems work  
- Common phishing techniques 
- Basic knowledge of email analysis tools

## Lab Set-up and Tools
To conduct a phishing attack investigation, you'll need a simulated environment that includes tools for email analysis. Hereâ€™s a detailed setup:

## 1. Email Server Simulation
Description: Set up a local email server or use an email simulation service to receive and send emails. This allows you to safely analyze phishing emails without exposing your real email account to potential risks.

Tools:

- Halon MTA: A flexible and powerful email server software.
- MailCatcher: A simple SMTP server which captures emails sent to it for later inspection.
- Mutt: A small but powerful text-based email client for UNIX operating systems.

## 2. Phishing Email Samples
Description: Obtain a set of phishing email samples to analyze. These can be sourced from public repositories, cybersecurity forums, or created for educational purposes.

Tools:

- PhishTank: A collaborative clearing house for data and information about phishing on the Internet.
- OpenPhish: A service providing free access to a continuously updated list of active phishing URLs.

## 3. Email Analysis Tools
- Thunderbird: An open-source email client by Mozilla that supports multiple email accounts and has powerful email management features.
- PhishTool: A tool specifically designed for analyzing and investigating phishing emails.
- Email Header Analysis Tools: Online tools like MXToolbox or EmailHeaders.net which can parse and analyze email headers.
